# StoreAPI

created this API just for the general understanding of how data filter works as well as how Pagination works in the project.
The data is generated from the json file inside the project and uploaded to Mongo server dynamically 
the data is from furniture store and a file consisiting of this data is name as products.json is in the files.

There is no Frontend which I amy ccreate in future but for now every funbctionality is implemented and verified through Postman.

Technologies use:
1.NodeJs with Express
2.MongoDB using Mongoose

Routes:
localhost:5000/api/v1/products?name=utopia sofa&featured=false&company=ikea&sort=-name&fields=name,price&limit=2&page=2&skip&price=&numericFilters=price>40

functions:
sort,find,paginate,format as you want using these arguments shown in the route.
